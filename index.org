  This is possibly your first introduction to a .org (dot org) file. In
  emacs/spacemacs there are many things you can do in "org-mode". In any other

  Guidance for coming up to speed with emacs/spacemacs/org-mode will be
  forthcoming. When in this mode, the links below can be visited by clicking on
  them, or else positioning the cursor on them and typing SPC u Ctrl-c Ctrl-o.
